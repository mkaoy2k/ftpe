    <h1>The Lesson of Life</h1>
    <div class="author">By Master Shengyan</div>
    
    <h2>A Lesson Everyone Must Take</h2>
    <p>When facing the death of a loved one, not only ordinary people, but even monks like me will feel sad. It is normal to feel sad, but it is best to transform this pain into a greater power to dedicate.</p>
    
    <p>The lesson of life and death is something everyone must take. Some people use their own lives to learn, and some learn from their loved ones. These are all profound experiences. Of course, there are also people who find teaching materials from books, but it is not easy to experience deeply. Since I can remember, I have experienced death at a very young age. Once I fell from a tree, and once I fell into a river, that I could have died. In my life, I have experienced several major disasters and saw corpses everywhere. At that time, I thought that death would come to me one day! Death is inevitable in life. What we can do is to prepare for death at any time.</p>
    
    <h2>Two Perspectives on Facing Death</h2>
    <p>In religion, there are two perspectives on death. The first places hope for life after death to be in a future heaven or Pure Land, aligning with one's faith, without any concern about when the time comes. This is a perspective found in all religions.</p>
    
    <div class="quote">
        <p>"Subhuti, neither the past, the present nor can the future mind be attainable"<br>
        <em>— CONTEMPLATING THE ONENESS OF EVERYTHING, Chapter 18</em></p>
    </div>
    
    <p>The past has already passed, the future has not yet happened, and even the present is short-lived and illusory.</p>
    
    <p>However, this is not meant to be negative, for the Diamond Sutra also says:</p>
    
    <div class="quote">
        <p>"Dwell nowhere and bring forth that mind"<br>
        <em>— ADORNING PURE LANDS, Chapter 10</em></p>
    </div>
    
    <p>"Dwell nowhere" means not dwelling on the past, not dwelling on the present, and not dwelling on the future.</p>
    
    <p>As for the "mind" that is brought forth, what is it? It refers to compassion for others and wisdom for oneself. As long as even one sentient being remains in suffering, our responsibility is not complete; as long as we still have afflictions, our responsibility is not complete.</p>
    
    <p>Ending one's own worry is wisdom; helping others be free from suffering is compassion. As for what the future holds, we need not be concerned.</p>
    
    <p>This is a higher perspective to achieve. It requires daily practicing to let go of one's worries and fears, as the Heart Sutra describes:</p>
    
    <div class="quote">
        <p>"With nothing to attain, a bodhisattva depends on prajna paramita, and thus the mind is without hindrance. Without hindrance, there is no fear."</p>
    </div>
    
    <p>If there is attachment, it is not true compassion but merely sympathy. True compassion is without attachment because it contains wisdom. Facing death with a mind free from attachment means that wherever we go, everywhere is a Pure Land.</p>
    
    <p>The Pure Land of Buddha is like a protective veil. The vows of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas will protect every sentient being until they are liberated through practice. If they are not yet liberated, but have reached the Pure Land of Buddha, they will not have all the worries of the human world, either.</p>
    
    <p>For ordinary people, to face death without fear, without attachment, and without delusion is very difficult—it requires dedicated practice in daily life.</p>
